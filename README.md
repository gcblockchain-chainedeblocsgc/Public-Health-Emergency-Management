This project is implemented using Hyperledger Composer playground.

To Import a model please follow instruction below:
Business Model Archive (BNA) file — you want to play around with it in Playground.
First, make sure Playground is up and running. Then under the Define tab, choose Import/Replace. 
On the Import/Replace Network screen, click Drop here to upload or browse, use the browse dialog to locate and 
select the BNA file you want to import, and choose Open. 
Then click Import and confirm that you want to replace the current model with the one you want to import.

Note: If you run into trouble importing the BNA file, you may need to clear your browser's local storage, 
then try the import again. See the section "Delete localhost browser storage" earlier in this tutorial for more information.
